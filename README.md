# Gentoo User Patches
A set of patches to be used with Gentoo's Portage. These patches usually include bugfixes and patches for personal experimentation.

## Installation
Simply copy this directory into `/etc/porage/patches/`

```
mkdir /etc/portage/patches
sudo cp -r * /etc/portage/patches/.

```

All patches will be automatically applied by portage when you used `emerge`.
